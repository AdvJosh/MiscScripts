# Miscellaneous Scripts
A place for me to place all my many scripts that aren't big enough/purposeful enough to deserve their own repo. Feel free to download, reuse, fork, contribute, or whatever else floats your boat.

You'll find all kinds of scripts and configuration files here as I slowly feel like writing and adding more of what I do online.

If you have questions or issues with any of my scripts, feel free to reach out. Understand though that nothing is offered with any kind of warranty, guarantee, or support. It may work fine for me, but totally break your system, so proceed with caution.
